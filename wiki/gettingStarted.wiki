==Getting Started==

This guide provides step by step configuration of Zing project, which is a Java based SNS site, conforming to opensocial specification.
===Assumption===
  # ${!ZingWeb} = path to !ZingWeb project
  # ${!ZingWebConfig} = path to !ZingWebConfig project
  # ${!Jetty_Home} = path to Jetty server

===Prerequisites===
  # JDK 1.6 
  # Maven 2.0.9
    * Set M2_HOME as environment variable.
    * Set Path variable and append %M2_HOME%/bin.

===Configuring Zing Database===
  # Download the database script zing_db.sql from [http://zing.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/zing/downloads/database/script/zing_db.sql], and execute the script on MySQL database.

===Configuring Zing===
  # Download projects !ZingWeb [http://zing.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/zing/ZingWeb] and !ZingWebConfig [http://zing.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/zing/ZingWebConfig]
  # Change the web.xml for !ZingWeb project located at ${!ZingWeb}/!WebContent/!WEB-INF and configure the "GadgetServerURL" parameter according to "ip-of-shindig-server" and "port".
  # Execute maven build file provided with !ZingWeb project. This will generate target  directory within the project, which contains "!ZingWeb" directory.
  # Download Jetty Server 6.1.9 from [http://dist.codehaus.org/jetty], and deploy the "!ZingWeb" exploded war in the  Jetty Server.
  # Browse to lib directory of "!ZingWeb" exploded war, then cut "el-api-6.0.18.jar" and paste it to ${!Jetty_Home}/lib/ext directory.
  # Browse to ${!ZingWebConfig}/configurations/persistence/persistence.xml. Configure this file based on database credentials.
  # Set COMPOSITE_CONFIG="${!ZingWebConfig}/configurations/configurationControlFile.xml" as environment variable.
   
===Configuring Shindig===
  # Download the Shindig revision: 687705 from Apache.
  ## Download !ZingShindigUpdate files from : http://zing.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/zing/downloads/zingshindigupdate/update_01.rar.
  ## Extract this rar, and make changes into SpiceDBLayer.java, to provide database credentials.
  # Remove the "test" folders within the "src" directory of common, gadgets, server & social-api projects of Shindig code. 
  ## Place these two files in "org.apache.shindig.social.sample.spi" package of Shindig's social-api project.  Use maven scripts to compile the Shindig code.
  # Deploy the generated Shindig war into ROOT directory of Jetty server. 

Finally, start the Jetty server and hit the URL: {{{http://<ip-of-your-machine>:<jetty-port>/ZingWeb/faces/pages/login.jspx}}}
