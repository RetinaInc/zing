=Getting Started=

This guide provides step by step configuration of Zing project, which is a Java based SNS site, conforming to opensocial specification.
==Assumption==
$\{ZingWeb\} = path to ZingWeb project
$\{ZingWebConfig\} = path to ZingWebConfig project

=CONFIGURING ZING=
  # Download projects ZingWeb and ZingWebConfig from =http://zing.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/zing=
  # Execute maven build file provided with ZingWeb project. This will generate target  directory within the project, which contains "ZingWeb" directory.
  # Download Jetty Server 6.1.9 from: http://dist.codehaus.org/jetty, and deploy the "ZingWeb" war in the  Jetty Server.
  # Browse to $\{ZingWebConfig\}/persistence/persistence.xml. Configure this file based on database credentials.
  # Set -DCOMPOSITE_CONFIG="$\{ZingWebConfig\}/configurations/configurationControlFile.xml" as environment variable.
   
=CONFIGURING SHINDIG=
  # Download the latest version of Shindig from Apache.
  ## Download ZingShindigUpdate files from : http://zing.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/zing/downloads/zingshindigupdate/update_01.rar.
  ## Extract this rar, and make changes into SpiceDBLayer.java, to provide database credentials.
  ## Place these two files in "org.apache.shindig.social.sample.spi" package of Shindig-OpenSocial-Api project.  Use maven scripts to compile the Shindig code.
  # Deploy the generated Shindig war into ROOT directory of Jetty server. 

=CONFIGURING DATABASE=
  # Download the database script zing_db.sql from http://zing.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/zing/downloads/database/script/ zing_db.sql, and execute the script on MySQL database.
Finally, start the Jetty server and hit the URL: http://<ip-of-your-machine>:<jetty-port>/ZingWeb/faces/pages/login.jspx
